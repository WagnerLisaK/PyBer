# PyBer

## Overview
PyBer is a ride-sharing company valued at $2.3 billion. An initial analysis was performed to analyze all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 to understand data points such as: total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare/rider, average fare/driver, and total fares by city type (Urban, Suburban, Rural).
Below you'll see the results of the analysis and a summary.

## Results
Most of the data illustrations are not surprising as shown below.

### Average Fares & Total Rides by City Type
The most rides with the least average cost take place in Urban cities versus Rural cities.

### Number of Rides by City Type
There are about 3-4 times the number of rides in Urban cities versus rural cities and there is only 1 outlier that falls in the Urban city data.

### Average Fares by City Type
Rural rides cost an average of $10 more than rides in Urban cities and there are no outliers in this data set.

### Average Drivers by City Type
As expected, the number of drivers in Rural cities is immensely lower (about 9 times lower).

### Percent of Fares & Rides by City Type
Urban cities bring in twice as much in fares as the Suburban cities and about 10 times the fares of Rural cities; the same is true for the number of total rides as well.

### Percent of Drivers by City Type
The total number of drivers per city type is dominated by the Urban cities at ~ 81%.  Even then, the Suburban cities have about 8 times the drivers as Rural cities do.

## Summary
To reduce the disparities between the city types, the following recommendations could be considered:
1. Raise the fares in Urban cities.
2. Lower the fares in Rural Cities.
3. Recruit more drivers in Rural Cities.
